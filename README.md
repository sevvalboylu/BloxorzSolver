# Bloxorz Solver
CS404-Artificial Intelligence Homework: Bloxorz Game Solver using UCS and A* algorithms

### UCS Algorithm:
Solves the puzzle by uniform cost search, using a self-implemented priority queue. 
Solving time is around 0,05 seconds for the given sample board.

### A* Algorithm:
Solves the puzzle by A* algorithm, heuristic function is determined by half of the the euclidean distance
Solving time is around 0,005 seconds for the given sample board.
